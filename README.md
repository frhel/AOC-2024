## Setting up a new day
Easily create a new project for each day that includes a ready-to-go solution template.
- Navigate to the root of the project
- Execute ```./create.sh <day>``` to create a new project for the day, where ```<day>``` is the day number.

## Running a solution
- Navigate to the directory of the day you want to run the solution for.
- Run ```npm run example``` to run the example input as a nodemon process.
- Run ```npm start``` to run the actual input once as a node process.
