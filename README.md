Advent of Code 2024

## Setting up a new day
Easily create a new project for each day that includes a ready-to-go solution template.
- Navigate to the root of the project
- Execute ```./new_day.sh <day>``` to create a new project for the day, where ```<day>``` is the day number.

## Running a solution
- Navigate to the directory of the day you want to run the solution for.
- Run ```npm run solve``` to run the solution for the day.
- - Alternatively, run ```nodemon``` in watch mode to run the solution for the day and automatically reload the solution when the source code changes. Nodemon can be installed globally by running ```npm install -g nodemon```.
- - Alternatively, run ```node solution.js``` to run the solution for the day.
